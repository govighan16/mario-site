                Goombas are common enemies in Super Mario. They resemble small
                brown mushrooms with two feet and no visible arms or legs.
              </p>
              <p>
                Goombas are physically weak and are not much of a threat to
                Mario or Luigi, since a single stomp usually defeats them

              <img src="assets/enemies/koopa.png" alt="Koopa Troopa" />
              <p>
                Koopa Troopas resemble turtles with green and red shells, some
                having wings. They are the minions of Bowser.
              </p>
              <p>
                Koopa Troopas have a unique trait - they retreat into their
                shells when attacked. This can make them tricky to handle,
                requiring Mario to jump on them strategically.

              <p>
                Hammer Bros are notorious for their relentless hammer-throwing
                antics which deal deadly damage.
              </p>
              <p>
                They continuously toss hammers from platforms or ledges, making
                it difficult for Mario to approach them. Precise timing and
                agility are essential to overcome these foes.

              <p>
                Piranha Plants are iconic, carnivorous foes that inhabit pipes
                throughout the Mushroom Kingdom.
              </p>
              <p>
                These menacing plants emerge from their pipes when Mario
                approaches, snapping at anything in their path. Often they can
                spew fire balls out at anything near them.

                Boos are mischievous ghosts haunting mansions and castles. They
                are known for their shy and timid nature, often covering their
                faces when approached.
              </p>
              <p>
                When someone looks away they pursue with relentless
                determination, and it's said that the only way to stop them is
                to face them head-on.

              <p>
                Koopalings are a group of seven troublemaking Koopas, each with
                a distinct personality for causing chaos, led by Bowser Jr.
              </p>
              <p>
                From the clever Ludwig von Koopa to the mischievous Lemmy, and
                the fiery Morton Jr, they are known for having various tough
                abilities to deal with.

                Thwomps are massive stone blocks with menacing faces that hang
                in the air. These relentless Thwomps are known for their
                persistence and present a formidable obstacle for Mario.
              </p>
              <p>
                When triggered, these heavyweights crash down with unrelenting
                force, attempting to flatten anything in their path. Only the
                quickest and most agile can get past them.

              <p>
                Bullet Bills are living projectiles that have become one of
                Mario's most recognizable foes. These high-speed, airborne
                menaces are missiles that won't stop until they hit their
                target.
              </p>
              <p>
                They often have a warning sound before their entrance, provide
                opportunities for Mario to show off his incredible agility as he
                dodges and outmaneuvers them to continue his adventures.

              <p>
                Dry Bones are skeletal Koopas that haunt abandoned hallways. Dry
                Bones are undeterred by ordinary stomps and often crumble into
                pieces when defeated but only to reassemble and continue
                pursuit.
              </p>
              <p>
                Dry Bones provide an extra layer of challenge which requires
                creative ways to deal with them, whether through special power
                ups or precise platforming.

              <p>
                Bowser, the ultimate final boss, is a giant, fire-breathing
                turtle wreaking havoc. He often captures Princess Peach and has
                an epic showdown with Mario.
              </p>
              <p>
                Bowser is very intelligent and commands a legion of loyal
                minions, including Koopa Troopas, Goombas, and others. He can
                only be defeated after a long war with his army...
